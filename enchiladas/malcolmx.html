        </p>Since it's a Mexican dish, I love it because it's soft and chewy, it has a great sauce flavor, and the spice is added just right. My first experience with enchiladas was amazing, and I love buying it whenever I can. After I bought it at Target or Walmart, the packaging was small, and I didn't realize how great it would be until I warmed it in the oven</p>
        </p>Enchiladas originated in Mexico, where tortillas were rolled around food as far back as Aztec times.Inventor Diana Kennedy cites an 1883 observation from a traveler who observed, "Enchiladas, a greasy tortilla sandwich filled with chiles and other uninviting compounds, are sold everywhere, filling the air with a pungent, nauseous smell."  People living in the Lake Region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. At the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal D*az del Castillo documented a feast hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included corn tortillas as a food item. Since the dish was made, people have added different spices, chicken or beef to give it some flavor.</p>

          <p>Red enchilada sauce begins with puréed tomato and broth, then is heavily seasoned with finely chopped garlic, onion, oregano, basil, cumin and ground red ancho (ripened poblano chiles). Enchiladas made with green chile and tomatillos are generally much hotter than those made with red chiles.
            Toppings for these ground beef enchiladas include spicy green salsa verde and a smoky tomato salsa, chopped tomatoes, green onions, cilantro and avocado.
            For saucy enchiladas, ground chicken or turkey would be a good substitute for ground beef. It is especially popular in the southwest to serve turkey.
            Instead of beef enchiladas, make ground chicken or turkey enchiladas to keep this recipe interesting.
            Finally, bake in the oven until done</p>
